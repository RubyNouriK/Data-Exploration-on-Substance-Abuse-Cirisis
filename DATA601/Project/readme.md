Comprehensive Analysis of the Canadian Opioid and Stimulants Crisis (2016-2024)

The purpose of this project is to conduct a deep analysis of the ongoing Canadian Opioid and Stimulants Crisis, examining key trends, patterns, and potential correlations to broader societal impacts.

**Data Sources and Scope**
The data analyzed in this project is publicly available and sourced from Health Canada, covering the period from 2016 to mid-2024 (January–June). To ensure a thorough and structured exploration, the data has been segmented across multiple dimensions, including:

* Geographic Breakdown: Analysis at the provincial level, considering regional differences.
* Temporal Trends: Examination of yearly and quarterly fluctuations in opioid and stimulant-related incidents.
* Substance-Specific Analysis: Differentiating between various opioids and stimulants to uncover usage patterns.
* Normalization by Population: Adjusting statistics based on population sizes to ensure fair comparisons across different regions.

**Objective and Analytical Approach**
As stated before, the primary goal of this study is not to provide a definitive conclusion or policy recommendations but to stratify the available data and extract meaningful insights. By identifying key trends, we aim to offer a data-driven perspective on the crisis, which can serve as a foundation for further discussion, research, or policy considerations if requested.

Additionally, this project serves as a technical demonstration of expertise in concepts demonstrated in DATA 601 classes over the last 6 weeks, such as:

* Storytelling with Data – presenting complex findings in a clear, insightful, and actionable way.
* Data Wrangling & Analysis – processing and structuring large datasets for meaningful exploration.
* Python-based Data Science Techniques – utilizing libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, NumPy, Matplotlib, and more to conduct statistical and visual analyses.

**Exploring Links to Crime Trends**

Beyond analyzing substance use trends, we also investigate potential links between the rise in opioid and stimulant-related cases and increasing crime rates across Canada. While we acknowledge the challenges in distinguishing between causation and correlation, this study highlights certain patterns that warrant further exploration.

**Transparency and Replicability**
All datasets used in this analysis are publicly accessible and regularly updated, ensuring that the findings are transparent, reproducible, and verifiable. We encourage further research and discussions based on these insights.
